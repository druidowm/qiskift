QiskiFT Demonstrations
===================================

Below are links to several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating QiskiFT's current functionalities.

* `This notebook <https://github.com/druidowm/qiskift/blob/main/qiskift/SteaneTestErrorCorrection.ipynb>`_ illustrates the building blocks of the Steane code.

* `This notebook <https://github.com/druidowm/qiskift/blob/main/qiskift/SteaneTestCircuit.ipynb>`_ illustrates how to use QiskiFT to create a (partially) fault tolerant circuit representation of Deutsch’s Algorithm using the Steane code.

* `This notebook <https://github.com/druidowm/qiskift/blob/main/qiskift/SteaneTestDag.ipynb>`_ illustrates how to use QiskiFT to create a (partially) fault tolerant Directed Acyclic Graph representation of Deutsch’s Algorithm using the Steane code.
